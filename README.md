Hello everyone, my name is Sarthak Sahu, and I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at VIT Bhopal University, pursuing my degree in Cloud Computing and Automation.

I am deeply interested in modern technologies, especially cloud platforms, automation tools, and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems. Alongside my technical journey, I am equally passionate about stage performance, with a special love for stand-up comedy and skit writing. Performing on stage allows me to express creativity, connect with people, and build confidence—skills that I believe are just as important as technical knowledge.

I consider myself a motivated learner who enjoys exploring new ideas, working on projects, and continuously improving both my professional and creative abilities. I look forward to building a career that blends technology, innovation, and creativity.
